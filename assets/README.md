## Cover Image Required

Please save the AI Paradox Report cover image (the split face with blue/red sides showing AI interfaces) in this directory as:

**`ai-paradox-cover.jpg`**

This image is used as:
- The main cover image on the website homepage
- The Open Graph social media preview image
- The Twitter Card image

The image shows a powerful visual metaphor for the AI paradox - a face split between blue (optimistic/beneficial) and red (concerned/fearful) sides, with AI interface elements overlaid, perfectly capturing the dual nature of AI sentiment among early adopters.
